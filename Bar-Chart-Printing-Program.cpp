/*(Bar-Chart Printing Program) One interesting application of computers is to display 
graphs and bar charts. Write an application that reads five numbers between 1 and 30. 
For each number thatâ€™s read, your program should display the same number of adjacent 
asterisks. For example, if your program reads the number 7, it should display ******* .
Display the bars of asterisks after you read all five numbers. (c++ how to program) */
